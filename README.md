# AI-Powered Code Reviewer CLI

A developer tool that performs a two-step code audit:

1.  **Static Analysis (AST):** Mathematically proves code quality (function length, imports) using Python's Abstract Syntax Tree.
2.  **AI Refactoring:** Uses the Gemini API to intelligently rewrite "smelly" code into clean, modular functions.
